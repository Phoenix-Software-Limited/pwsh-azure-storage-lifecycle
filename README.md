# Azure Storage Lifecycle Policy - Pre-Audit Script

A PowerShell tool for analyzing Azure Storage Accounts to assess the impact of implementing lifecycle policies before actual deployment.

## Overview

This script provides detailed analysis of your Azure Storage Account contents, helping you make informed decisions about lifecycle policies by showing:
- Data age distribution across all containers
- Number and size of blobs that would be affected
- Estimated cost savings (monthly and annual)
- Detailed reports in multiple formats

## Scripts Available

### ðŸ“„ pre-audit-script.ps1 (Original)
Sequential processing - works on PowerShell 5.1+

### âš¡ pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1 (Multi-Threaded)
**4-8x faster** parallel processing - requires PowerShell 7.0+
- Processes multiple containers simultaneously
- Configurable thread limit (default: 5)
- Ideal for storage accounts with many containers

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Age Distribution Analysis** - Categorizes blobs into age groups (0-7 days, 8-30 days, 31-60 days, etc.)
- ðŸ’° **Cost Impact Analysis** - Calculates potential monthly and annual savings
- ðŸ“ˆ **Container-Level Breakdown** - Detailed analysis for each container
- ðŸ“„ **Multiple Export Formats** - CSV for detailed data, TXT for executive summaries
- ðŸŽ¨ **Rich Console Output** - Color-coded, progress-tracked analysis
- âš¡ **Safe & Read-Only** - No modifications to your storage account

## Requirements

### For Original Script (pre-audit-script.ps1)
- **PowerShell**: 5.1 or higher
- **Azure Modules**: `Az.Accounts` (â‰¥2.10.0), `Az.Storage` (â‰¥5.0.0)

### For Parallel Script (pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1)
- **PowerShell**: 7.0 or higher (REQUIRED)
- **Azure Modules**: `Az.Accounts` (â‰¥2.10.0), `Az.Storage` (â‰¥5.0.0)

## Installation

### 1. Install Required Modules

```powershell
# Install Az.Accounts module
Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -MinimumVersion 2.10.0 -Scope CurrentUser -Force

# Install Az.Storage module
Install-Module -Name Az.Storage -MinimumVersion 5.0.0 -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

```

## Usage

### Original Script (Sequential)

```powershell
# Basic usage

    -resourceGroup "myResourceGroup" `
    -storageAccount "mystorageaccount" `
    -retentionDays 90
```

    -resourceGroup "myResourceGroup" `
    -storageAccount "mystorageaccount" `
    -retentionDays 90 `
    -ThrottleLimit 10

# Force PowerShell 7 and bypass execution policy
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1 `
    -resourceGroup "myResourceGroup" `
    -storageAccount "mystorageaccount" `
    -retentionDays 90

**Which script should you use?**
- **Use parallel script** if you have PowerShell 7+ and 10+ containers
- **Use original script** if on PowerShell 5.1 or prefer sequential processing

## Output

The script generates three types of output:

### 1. Console Output
Rich, color-coded analysis displayed in real-time showing:
- Per-container analysis with age distribution
- Impact summary
- Cost savings estimates

### 2. CSV Report
Detailed spreadsheet with columns:
- Container name
- Total blob count and size
- Blobs/size to delete
- Percentage to delete
- Estimated monthly savings

### 3. Summary Text Report
Executive summary including:
- Overall statistics
- Impact analysis
- Cost savings breakdown
- Top 5 containers by deletion size

## Use Cases

### Before Implementing Lifecycle Policies
Run this script to understand the impact before applying lifecycle management rules:
- See exactly how much data will be affected
- Identify containers with old data
- Calculate potential savings
- Present findings to stakeholders

### Regular Compliance Audits
Use periodically to:
- Monitor data growth patterns
- Identify storage optimization opportunities
- Track data retention compliance
- Generate reports for management

### Cost Optimization Projects
Essential for:
- Storage cost reduction initiatives
- Cloud spend optimization reviews
- Budget planning and forecasting

## Customization

### Adjusting Cost Calculations
The script uses UK South pricing by default. To adjust for your region, edit line 42:

```powershell
$costPerGBMonth = 0.0184  # Change this to your region's pricing
```

Find your region's pricing at: [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

### Custom Age Buckets
To modify age distribution categories, edit the `Group-Object` section (lines 90-98).

## Best Practices

1. **Test on Non-Production First** - Always run on dev/test accounts before production
2. **Review Reports Carefully** - Analyze the age distribution before setting retention policies
3. **Consider Business Requirements** - Align retention days with compliance and business needs
4. **Run Regular Audits** - Schedule periodic audits to track trends
5. **Save Reports** - Keep audit reports for compliance and historical tracking

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to access storage account"
- Verify you're connected to Azure: `Get-AzContext`
- Ensure you have permissions on the storage account (Reader or higher)
- Check the resource group and storage account names are correct

### "The term 'Get-AzStorageAccount' is not recognized"
- Install/update the Az.Storage module: `Install-Module -Name Az.Storage -Force`

### Performance Issues with Large Storage Accounts
- **Use the parallel script** for storage accounts with many containers
- **Do NOT use ThrottleLimit above 10** - this causes Azure throttling and hangs
- Start with default (5 threads), increase carefully to 8-10 maximum
- If containers timeout, reduce `-ThrottleLimit` to 3-5
- Increase `-TimeoutMinutes` for containers with many blobs
- Consider running during off-peak hours
- Monitor progress via the console output

### Script Hangs or Times Out
If the script hangs at "Get-AzStorageBlob task status" or containers time out:

**Cause:** Using too many parallel threads (> 10) causes Azure to throttle requests

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Reduce throttle limit to 5 or lower
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1 `
    -resourceGroup "rg" `
    -storageAccount "sa" `
    -retentionDays 90 `
    -ThrottleLimit 5

# If still timing out, increase timeout and reduce threads
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1 `
    -resourceGroup "rg" `
    -storageAccount "sa" `
    -retentionDays 90 `
    -ThrottleLimit 3 `
    -TimeoutMinutes 60
```

**Important:** The script will now automatically skip containers that timeout and continue processing others. Failed containers are listed in the summary.

### "Script requires PowerShell 7.0 or higher"
- The parallel script requires PowerShell 7+
- Install: `winget install Microsoft.PowerShell`
- Or use the original script which supports PowerShell 5.1

### Execution Policy Issues
If you encounter execution policy restrictions:

```powershell
# Option 1: Bypass execution policy for this session only
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1 -resourceGroup "rg" -storageAccount "sa" -retentionDays 90

# Option 2: Set execution policy for current user (permanent)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Option 3: Unblock the script file
Unblock-File -Path .\pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1
```

### Ensuring PowerShell 7 is Used
```powershell
# Check current PowerShell version
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion

# Force PowerShell 7 (if installed)
pwsh -File .\pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1 -resourceGroup "rg" -storageAccount "sa" -retentionDays 90

# Combine: Force PowerShell 7 AND bypass execution policy
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\pre-audit-script-parallel.ps1 -resourceGroup "rg" -storageAccount "sa" -retentionDays 90
```
